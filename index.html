                Hi, My name is Mark and I have created this webpage to introduce you to the beautifull town of
                Falcarragh in County Donegal.
                I am originally from The Netherlands and moved to Ireland back in 2018 for work and love.
                My girlfriend is Irish and she is from Falcarragh.
            </p>

            <p>
                We started to live together in the area at the start of the first lockdown.
                During this time we did regular walks on the beach and were climbing some serious mountains.
                The scenery and nature are in 1 word spectacular and it is one of the lesser known corners within
                The Republic of Ireland.
                So I have decided to create this source of information so that you might be convinced to visit this
                beautifull County.
            </p>

        <h1>History of Falcarragh</h1>
        <div id="history-container">
            <p>
                The name Falcarragh (lit. An (the) Fál (Wall) Carrach (Stone), Stone Wall / Boundary) has been used since 1850, 
                ascribed so by O' Donavan as he believed 'Na Crois Bhealaí', the Cross Roads, was too common in Ireland to allow distinction. 
                Na Crois Bhealaí is still used by native speakers when referring to the town. On some maps it shows up as 'Crossroads' deriving from its Irish language 
                name Na Croisbhealaí but older maps refer to it as Robinson's Town, but it is now listed as An Fál Carrach. 
                An Fál Carrach, the main commercial town between Letterkenny and Dungloe was known in former times both as Crossroads and as Robinson’s Town. 
                An Fál Carrach, the official name, originally referred to a little hamlet south-east of the present town, at the foot of Falcarragh hill - 
                but gradually houses were built at the crossroads, mainly for the workers and tradespeople employed on the Olphert Estate in Ballyconnell.
